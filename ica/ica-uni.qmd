### Importance of Visualizations

#### EXAMPLE 1 {-}


```{r}
# Import data
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
```

### Components of Data Graphics

#### EXAMPLE 3 {-}

Data viz is the process of *mapping* data to different plot components. For example, in the NYT example above, the research team *mapped* data like the following (but with many more rows!) to the plot.

| observation | decade  | year | date | relative temp |
|:------------|:-------:|:----:|:----:|:-------------:|
| 1           | 2020-30 | 2023 | 1/23 |      1.2      |
| 2           | 1940-60 | 1945 | 3/45 |     -0.05     |





## Exercises

```{r}
#| eval: true

# Import data
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
```


### Exercise 1: Research Questions {.unnumbered}

Let's dig into the `hikes` data, starting with the `elevation` and difficulty `ratings` of the hikes:

```{r}
#| eval: true

head(hikes)
```

a.  What features would we like a visualization of the *categorical* difficulty `rating` variable to capture? 
How many hikes are therein each category?
b.  What about a visualization of the *quantitative* `elevation` variable?
What is the range in elevations.



### Exercise 2: Load tidyverse {.unnumbered}

We'll address the above questions using `ggplot` tools. Try running the following chunk and simply take note of the error message -- this is one you'll get a lot!

```{r}
# Use the ggplot function
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))
```

In order to use `ggplot` tools, we have to first *load* the `tidyverse` package in which they live. We've *installed* the package but we need to tell R when we want to *use* it. Run the chunk below to load the library. You'll need to do this within any .qmd file that uses `ggplot()`.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| message: false

# Load the package
library(tidyverse)
```



### Exercise 3: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 1 {.unnumbered}

Consider some specific research questions about the difficulty `rating` of the hikes:

1. How many hikes fall into each category?
2. Are the hikes evenly distributed among these categories, or are some more common than others?

All of these questions can be answered with: (1) a **bar chart**; of (2) the *categorical* data recorded in the `rating` column. First, set up the plotting **frame**:

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))
```

Think about:

-   What did this do? What do you observe?
A blank graph 
-   What, in general, is the first argument of the `ggplot()` function?
the name of the dataset
-   What is the purpose of writing `x = rating`?
Indicate the variable on x-axis
-   What do you think `aes` stands for?!?
aesthetics


### Exercise 4: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 2 {.unnumbered}

Now let's add a **geometric layer** to the frame / canvas, and start customizing the plot's **theme**. To this end, try each chunk below, *one by one*. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.

NOTE:

-   Pay attention to the general code properties and structure, not memorization.
-   Not all of these are "good" plots. We're just exploring `ggplot`.

```{r}
# Add a bar plot layer
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
# Add the name of axis
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes")
```

```{r}
# Fill the bars with blue color
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes")
```

```{r}
#  Color the outline of the bars in orange color
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(color = "orange", fill = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes")
```

```{r}
# Have a white background
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(color = "orange", fill = "blue")  +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes") +
  theme_minimal()
```



### Exercise 5: Bar Chart Follow-up {.unnumbered}

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

Reflect on the `ggplot()` code.

-   What's the purpose of the `+`? When do we use it?
To indicate there is another layer adding.
-   We added the bars using `geom_bar()`? Why "geom"?
"Geom" stands for geometric
-   What does `labs()` stand for?
labels
-   What's the difference between `color` and `fill`?
Fill fills the color in the bars, while the color outlines the bars.

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

In general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a *categorical* variable:

-   **observed categories**: What categories did we observe?
-   **variability between categories**: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others?

We must then *translate* this information into the *context* of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Summarize below what you learned from the bar chart, in context.

Very few number of hikes are difficult, and most of hikes are moderate.

#### Part c {.unnumbered}

Is there anything you don't like about this barplot? For example: check out the x-axis again.

They can be placed by the level of difficulties.

### Exercise 6: Sad Bar Chart {.unnumbered}

Let's now consider some research questions related to the *quantitative* `elevation` variable:

1. Among the hikes, what's the *range* of elevation and how are the hikes *distributed* within this range (e.g. evenly, in clumps, "normally")?
2. What's a *typical* elevation?
3. Are there any *outliers*, i.e. hikes that have unusually high or low elevations?

Here:

-   Construct a **bar chart** of the *quantitative* `elevation` variable.
-   Explain why this might *not* be an effective visualization for this and other quantitative variables. (What questions does / doesn't it help answer?)
There are too many different data of elevation.

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + 
  geom_bar()
```



### Exercise 7: A Histogram of Elevation {.unnumbered}

Quantitative variables require different viz than categorical variables. Especially when there are many possible outcomes of the quantitative variable. It's typically insufficient to simply count up the number of times we've observed a particular outcome as the bar graph did above. It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range. We'll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: **histograms** and **density plots**.

**Histograms** are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into 'bins' of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin. Check out the example below:

![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/histogram_demo.png){width="50%"}

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

Let's dig into some details.

-   How many hikes have an elevation between 4500 and 4700 feet?
6
-   How many total hikes have an elevation of at least 5100 feet?
2

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

Now the bigger picture. In general, histograms allow us to examine the following properties of a *quantitative* variable:

-   **typical outcome:** Whereâ€™s the center of the data points? What's typical?
-   **variability & range:** How spread out are the outcomes? What are the max and min outcomes?
-   **shape:** How are values distributed along the observed range? Is the distribution symmetric, right-skewed, left-skewed, bi-modal, or uniform (flat)?
-   **outliers:** Are there any outliers, i.e. outcomes that are unusually large/small?

We must then *translate* this information into the *context* of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Addressing each of the features in the above list, summarize below what you learned from the histogram, in context.



### Exercise 8: Building Histograms - Part 1 {.unnumbered}

2-MINUTE CHALLENGE: Thinking of the bar chart code, try to *intuit* what line you can tack on to the below frame of `elevation` to add a histogram layer. Don't forget a `+`. If it doesn't come to you within 2 minutes, *no problem* -- all will be revealed in the next exercise.

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation))
```


### Exercise 9: Building Histograms - Part 2 {.unnumbered}

Let's build some histograms. Try each chunk below, *one by one*. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.

```{r}
# Add a histogram layer
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
#  Outline the bars in white
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") 
```

```{r}
# Fill the bars in blue
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "blue") 
```

```{r}
# Add axis labels
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```

```{r}
# Change the width of the bins to 1000 feet
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 1000) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```

```{r}
# Change the width of the bins to 5 feet
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 5) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```

```{r}
#  Change the width of the bins to 200 feet
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 200) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```


### Exercise 10: Histogram Follow-up {.unnumbered}

-   What function added the histogram layer / geometry?
geom_histogram()
-   What's the difference between `color` and `fill`?
color outlined the bars and fill filled them
-   Why does adding `color = "white"` improve the visualization?
easier to distinguish 
-   What did `binwidth` do?
change the width
-   Why does the histogram become ineffective if the `binwidth` is too big (e.g. 1000 feet)?
It has many hikes together, which makes it not readable
-   Why does the histogram become ineffective if the `binwidth` is too small (e.g. 5 feet)?
lose the trends of the data.

### Exercise 11: Density Plots {.unnumbered}

**Density plots** are essentially smooth versions of the histogram. Instead of sorting observations into discrete bins, the "density" of observations is calculated across the entire range of outcomes. The greater the number of observations, the greater the density! The density is then scaled so that the area under the density curve **always equals 1** and the area under any fraction of the curve represents the fraction of cases that lie in that range.

Check out a density plot of elevation. Notice that the y-axis (density) has no contextual interpretation -- it's a relative measure. The *higher* the density, the more *common* are elevations in that range.

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_density(color="blue",fill="orange")
```

**Questions**

-   INTUITION CHECK: Before tweaking the code and thinking back to `geom_bar()` and `geom_histogram()`, how do you *anticipate* the following code will change the plot?

    -   `geom_density(color = "blue")`
    -   `geom_density(fill = "orange")`

-   TRY IT! Test out those lines in the chunk below. Was your intuition correct?

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_density(color="blue")
 ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_density(fill="orange")
```

-   Examine the density plot. How does it compare to the histogram? What does it tell you about the *typical* elevation, *variability / range* in elevations, and *shape* of the distribution of *elevations* within this range?



### Exercise 12: Density Plots vs Histograms {.unnumbered}

The histogram and density plot both allow us to visualize the behavior of a quantitative variable: typical outcome, variability / range, shape, and outliers. What are the pros/cons of each? What do you like/not like about each?
I like the way it clear shows the relationship between two kinds of variables.

### Exercise 13: Code = communication {.unnumbered}

We *obviously* won't be done until we talk about communication. All code above has a similar *general* structure (where the details can change):

```{r}
#| eval: false

```

-   Though not *necessary* to the code working, it's common, good practice to *indent* or *tab* the lines of code after the first line (counterexample below). Why?

```{r}
# YUCK
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 200) +
labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```

-   Though not *necessary* to the code working, it's common, good practice to put a *line break* after each `+` (counterexample below). Why?

```{r}
# YUCK 
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 200) + labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```
