title: "Univariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.
# the uni-viz
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
#| fig-cap: "The relationship between elevation and hikes"
#| fig-alt: "This density plot shows the distribution of elevation and hikers, and it generally shows most hikes are moderate,data from https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv"
 ggplot(hikes,aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_density(fill="orange",color="blue")+
   labs(x="elevation of hikes",y="density of hikes")
```
