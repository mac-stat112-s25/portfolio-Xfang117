Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
education <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv")
#| fig-cap: "The relationship of SAT score,the percentage of students have the SAT and the expend in different states"
#| fig-alt: "This point plot shows in general,the higher expenditure means higher SAT score, including the difference of percentages of students take SAT,data from https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv"
ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = expend, color = fracCat)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  labs(x="The expenditure and the salary of teachers in the state",y="The average SAT score", color="The relative percentage of students have the SAT")
