This is inseparable from two important reasons: one is the geographical advantage, and the other is their proximity to a developed economic center. First, take Guangdong Province as an example. Its proximity to the intersection of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean has brought about a huge amount of shipping, promoting economic development. At the same time, its proximity to Hong Kong, a developed economic and trade city, provides more opportunities. Jiangsu, on the other hand, has ensured sufficient Commodity Exchange through trade with Japan, South Korea and the Pacific Ocean, which has vigorously developed an ocean-centered economy. However, in addition to this, Jiangsu also has a huge river flow, which has played a significant role in both international trade and the domestic market. At the same time, just like Guangzhou Province, Jiangsu also relies on a highly developed economic center like Shanghai, which provides more job opportunities for Jiangsu. While understanding the development of these two cities, we realize that those inland provinces lack such opportunities, and therefore their economic development is slower. This is a problem worthy of people’s attention.",

    "text": "11.1 Exercises\n\nCode# Import data\nhikes &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv\")\n\n\nExercise 1: Research Questions\nLet’s dig into the hikes data, starting with the elevation and difficulty ratings of the hikes:\n\nCodehead(hikes)\n\n             peak elevation difficulty ascent length time    rating\n1     Mt. Marcy        5344          5   3166   14.8 10.0  moderate\n2 Algonquin Peak       5114          5   2936    9.6  9.0  moderate\n3   Mt. Haystack       4960          7   3570   17.8 12.0 difficult\n4   Mt. Skylight       4926          7   4265   17.9 15.0 difficult\n5 Whiteface Mtn.       4867          4   2535   10.4  8.5      easy\n6       Dix Mtn.       4857          5   2800   13.2 10.0  moderate\n\n\n\nWhat features would we like a visualization of the categorical difficulty rating variable to capture? How many hikes are therein each category?\nWhat about a visualization of the quantitative elevation variable? What is the range in elevations.\nExercise 2: Load tidyverse\nWe’ll address the above questions using ggplot tools. Try running the following chunk and simply take note of the error message – this is one you’ll get a lot!\n\nCode# Use the ggplot function\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\n\nIn order to use ggplot tools, we have to first load the tidyverse package in which they live. We’ve installed the package but we need to tell R when we want to use it. Run the chunk below to load the library. You’ll need to do this within any .qmd file that uses ggplot().\n\nCode# Load the package\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\nExercise 3: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 1\nConsider some specific research questions about the difficulty rating of the hikes:\n\nHow many hikes fall into each category?\nAre the hikes evenly distributed among these categories, or are some more common than others?\n\nAll of these questions can be answered with: (1) a bar chart; of (2) the categorical data recorded in the rating column. First, set up the plotting frame:\n\nCodeggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\n\nThink about:\n\nWhat did this do? What do you observe? A blank graph\nWhat, in general, is the first argument of the ggplot() function? the name of the dataset\nWhat is the purpose of writing x = rating? Indicate the variable on x-axis\nWhat do you think aes stands for?!? aesthetics\nExercise 4: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 2\nNow let’s add a geometric layer to the frame / canvas, and start customizing the plot’s theme. To this end, try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\nNOTE:\n\nPay attention to the general code properties and structure, not memorization.\nNot all of these are “good” plots. We’re just exploring ggplot.\n\n\nCode# Add a bar plot layer\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\nCode# Add the name of axis\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\nCode# Fill the bars with blue color\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\nCode#  Color the outline of the bars in orange color\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\nCode# Have a white background\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\")  +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\nExercise 5: Bar Chart Follow-up\nPart a\nReflect on the ggplot() code.\n\nWhat’s the purpose of the +? When do we use it? To indicate there is another layer adding.\nWe added the bars using geom_bar()? Why “geom”? “Geom” stands for geometric\nWhat does labs() stand for? labels\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill? Fill fills the color in the bars, while the color outlines the bars.\nPart b\nIn general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a categorical variable:\n\n\nobserved categories: What categories did we observe?\n\nvariability between categories: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others?\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Summarize below what you learned from the bar chart, in context.\nVery few number of hikes are difficult, and most of hikes are moderate.\nPart c\nIs there anything you don’t like about this barplot? For example: check out the x-axis again.\nThey can be placed by the level of difficulties.\nExercise 6: Sad Bar Chart\nLet’s now consider some research questions related to the quantitative elevation variable:\n\nAmong the hikes, what’s the range of elevation and how are the hikes distributed within this range (e.g. evenly, in clumps, “normally”)?\nWhat’s a typical elevation?\nAre there any outliers, i.e. hikes that have unusually high or low elevations?\n\nHere:\n\nConstruct a bar chart of the quantitative elevation variable.\nExplain why this might not be an effective visualization for this and other quantitative variables. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?) There are too many different data of elevation.\n\n\nCodeggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + \n  geom_bar()\n\n\nExercise 7: A Histogram of Elevation\nQuantitative variables require different viz than categorical variables. Especially when there are many possible outcomes of the quantitative variable. It’s typically insufficient to simply count up the number of times we’ve observed a particular outcome as the bar graph did above. It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range. We’ll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: histograms and density plots.\nHistograms are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into ‘bins’ of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin. Check out the example below:\n\nPart a\nLet’s dig into some details.\n\nHow many hikes have an elevation between 4500 and 4700 feet? 6\nHow many total hikes have an elevation of at least 5100 feet? 2\nPart b\nNow the bigger picture. In general, histograms allow us to examine the following properties of a quantitative variable:\n\n\ntypical outcome: Where’s the center of the data points? What’s typical?\n\nvariability & range: How spread out are the outcomes? What are the max and min outcomes?\n\nshape: How are values distributed along the observed range? Is the distribution symmetric, right-skewed, left-skewed, bi-modal, or uniform (flat)?\n\noutliers: Are there any outliers, i.e. outcomes that are unusually large/small?\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Addressing each of the features in the above list, summarize below what you learned from the histogram, in context.\nExercise 8: Building Histograms - Part 1\n2-MINUTE CHALLENGE: Thinking of the bar chart code, try to intuit what line you can tack on to the below frame of elevation to add a histogram layer. Don’t forget a +. If it doesn’t come to you within 2 minutes, no problem – all will be revealed in the next exercise.\n\nCodeggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation))\n\n\nExercise 9: Building Histograms - Part 2\nLet’s build some histograms. Try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\n\nCode# Add a histogram layer\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n\n\nCode#  Outline the bars in white\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") \n\n\n\nCode# Fill the bars in blue\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", fill = \"blue\") \n\n\n\nCode# Add axis labels\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\nCode# Change the width of the bins to 1000 feet\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 1000) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\nCode# Change the width of the bins to 5 feet\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 5) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\nCode#  Change the width of the bins to 200 feet\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\nExercise 10: Histogram Follow-up\n\nWhat function added the histogram layer / geometry? geom_histogram()\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill? color outlined the bars and fill filled them\nWhy does adding color = \"white\" improve the visualization? easier to distinguish\nWhat did binwidth do? change the width\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too big (e.g. 1000 feet)? It has many hikes together, which makes it not readable\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too small (e.g. 5 feet)? lose the trends of the data.\nExercise 11: Density Plots\nDensity plots are essentially smooth versions of the histogram. Instead of sorting observations into discrete bins, the “density” of observations is calculated across the entire range of outcomes. The greater the number of observations, the greater the density! The density is then scaled so that the area under the density curve always equals 1 and the area under any fraction of the curve represents the fraction of cases that lie in that range.\nCheck out a density plot of elevation. Notice that the y-axis (density) has no contextual interpretation – it’s a relative measure. The higher the density, the more common are elevations in that range.\n\nCodeggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density(color=\"blue\",fill=\"orange\")\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\nINTUITION CHECK: Before tweaking the code and thinking back to geom_bar() and geom_histogram(), how do you anticipate the following code will change the plot?\n\ngeom_density(color = \"blue\")\ngeom_density(fill = \"orange\")\n\n\nTRY IT! Test out those lines in the chunk below. Was your intuition correct?\n\n\nCodeggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density(color=\"blue\")\n ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density(fill=\"orange\")\n\n\n\nExamine the density plot. How does it compare to the histogram? What does it tell you about the typical elevation, variability / range in elevations, and shape of the distribution of elevations within this range?\nExercise 12: Density Plots vs Histograms\nThe histogram and density plot both allow us to visualize the behavior of a quantitative variable: typical outcome, variability / range, shape, and outliers. What are the pros/cons of each? What do you like/not like about each? I like the way it clear shows the relationship between two kinds of variables.\nExercise 13: Code = communication\nWe obviously won’t be done until we talk about communication. All code above has a similar general structure (where the details can change):\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to indent or tab the lines of code after the first line (counterexample below). Why?\n\n\nCode# YUCK\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\ngeom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\nlabs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to put a line break after each + (counterexample below). Why?\n\n\nCode# YUCK \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) + labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\nExercise 14: Practice\nPart a\nPractice your viz skills to learn about some of the variables in one of the following datasets from the previous class:\n\nCode# Data on students in this class\nsurvey &lt;- read.csv(\"https://hash-mac.github.io/stat112site-s25/data/survey.csv\")\n\n# World Cup data\nworld_cup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv\")\n\n\nPart b\nCheck out the RStudio Data Visualization cheat sheet to learn more features of ggplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck → Commit → Push\n\n\n\nWhen done, don’t forgot to click Render Book and check the resulting HTML files. If happy, jump to GitHub Desktop and commit the changes with the message Finish uni viz and push to GitHub. Wait few seconds, then visit your portfolio website and make sure the changes are there.",

    "text": "12.2 New stuff\nThus far, we’ve been studying one variable at a time, using univariate plots. But once we get a sense of how individual variables behave on their own, our questions often turn to relationships among variables. For example, in our hikes data:\n\nHow much time does it take to complete a hike? ——&gt; How is time related to a hike’s elevation? What about its length?\nHow does difficult rating vary from hike to hike? ——-&gt; How is difficulty rating related to a hike’s ascent?\n\n\n12.2.1 Exploring relationships\nExploring univariate patterns often sparks follow-up questions about relationships between 2+ variables. Often, but not always, variables take on specific roles:\n\n\nresponse variable: the variable whose variability we would like to explain (time to complete a hike)\n\npredictors: variables that might explain some of the variability in the response (a hike’s elevation or length)\n\nVisualizations can help explore:\n\nrelationship trends (direction and form)\nrelationship strength (degree of variability from the trend)\n\noutliers in the relationship\n\nEXAMPLE 3\nFor each pair of variables below, sketch on paper a visualization of their relationship. Focus on general viz process, don’t worry about the exact details. The data here are totally made up.\n\n3pm temperature (response) vs 9am temperature (predictor)\n\n\ndata.frame(temp_3pm = c(24, 26, 20, 15, 15, 15), temp_9am = c(14, 18, 15, 13, 11, 11))\n\n  temp_3pm temp_9am\n1       24       14\n2       26       18\n3       20       15\n4       15       13\n5       15       11\n6       15       11\n\n\n\n3pm temperature (response) vs location (predictor)\n\n\nweather &lt;- data.frame(temp_3pm = c(24, 26, 20, 15, 15, 0, 40, 60, 57, 44, 51, 75),\n                      location = rep(c(\"A\", \"B\"), each = 6))\nweather\n\n   temp_3pm location\n1        24        A\n2        26        A\n3        20        A\n4        15        A\n5        15        A\n6         0        A\n7        40        B\n8        60        B\n9        57        B\n10       44        B\n11       51        B\n12       75        B\n\n\nThink: How might we modify the below density plot of temp_3pm to distinguish between locations?\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp_3pm)) +\n      geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrain_today (the response) and location (the predictor)\n\n\nweather &lt;- data.frame(rain_today = c(\"no\", \"no\", \"no\", \"no\", \"yes\", \"no\", \"yes\", \"no\", \"yes\", \"yes\", \"no\", \"yes\"),\n                        location = c(rep(\"A\", 7), rep(\"B\", 5)))\n    weather\n\n   rain_today location\n1          no        A\n2          no        A\n3          no        A\n4          no        A\n5         yes        A\n6          no        A\n7         yes        A\n8          no        B\n9         yes        B\n10        yes        B\n11         no        B\n12        yes        B\n\n\nThink: How might we modify the below bar plot of location to distinguish between days on which it did or didn’t rain?\n\nggplot(weather, aes(x = location)) +\n      geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2.2 General guidance for building bivariate plots\nAs with univariate plots, an appropriate visualization for the relationship between 2 variables depends upon whether the variables are quantitative or categorical. In general:\n\nEach quantitative variable requires a new axis (or a quantitative scale if we run out of axes).\nEach categorical variable requires a new way to “group” the graphic (eg: using colors, shapes, separate facets, etc)\nFor visualizations in which overlap in glyphs or plots obscures the patterns, try faceting or transparency.",

Construct a plot of repub_pct_20.\nNotice that the distribution of Republican support from county to county is slightly left skewed or negatively skewed.\nWhat follow-up questions do you have?\n\nggplot(elections,aes(x=repub_pct_20)) +\ngeom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1: Quantitative vs Quantitative Intuition Check\nBelow is a scatterplot of the Republican support in 2020 vs 2016. Notice that:\n\nboth variables are quantitative, and get their own axes\nthe response variable is on the y-axis, demonstrating how repub_pct_20 might be predicted by repub_pct_16, not vice versa\n\nTry to replicate this using ggplot(). THINK:\n\nWhat info do you need to set up the canvas?\nWhat geometric layer (geom_???) might add these dots / points for each county? We haven’t learned this yet, just take some guesses.\n\n\nExercise 2: 2 Quantitiative Variables\nRun each chunk below to build up a a scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs repub_pct_16 with different glyphs representing each county. Address or think about any prompts in the comments (#).\n\n# Set up the plotting frame\n# How does this differ than the frame for our histogram of repub_pct_20 alone?\n#There are two variables\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16))\n\n\n# Add a layer of points for each county\n# Take note of the geom! geom_poit\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n# Change the shape of the points\n# What happens if you change the shape to another number?\n#It changes from a spot to a cross\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point(shape = 3)\n\n\n# YOU TRY: Modify the code to make the points \"orange\"\n# NOTE: Try to anticipate if \"color\" or \"fill\" will be useful here. Then try both.\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point(color=\"orange\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Add a layer that represents each county by the state it's in\n# Take note of the geom and the info it needs to run!\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = state_abbr))\n\nExercise 3: Reflect\nSummarize the relationship between the Republican support in 2020 and 2016. Be sure to comment on:\n\nthe strength of the relationship (weak/moderate/strong)\n\nthe direction of the relationship (positive/negative)\n\noutliers (in what state do counties deviate from the national trend? Any ideas why this might be the case?) There is a strong positive relation.\nExercise 4: Visualizing trend\nThe trend of the relationship between repub_pct_20 and repub_pct_16 is clearly positive and (mostly) linear. We can highlight this trend by adding a model “smooth” to the plot:\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n\nPart a\nConstruct a new plot that contains the model smooth but does not include the individual point glyphs.\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_smooth()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nBy default, geom_smooth() adds a smooth, localized model line. To examine the “best” linear model, we can specify method = \"lm\". It’s pretty similar in this example!\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\nExercise 5: Your Turn\nTo examine how the 2020 results are related to some county demographics, construct scatterplots of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent, and repub_pct_20 vs median_age. Summarize the relationship between these two variables and comment on which is the better predictor of repub_pct_20, median_rent or median_age.\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_rent)) +\n  geom_point() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_age\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_age\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_age)) +\n  geom_point() \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6: A Sad Scatterplot\nNext, let’s explore the relationship between a county’s 2020 Republican support repub_pct_20 and the historical political trends in its state. In this case repub_pct_20 is quantitative, but historical is categorical. Explain why a scatterplot might not be an effective visualization for exploring this relationship. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: Quantitative vs Categorical – Violins & Boxes\nThough the above scatterplot did group the counties by historical category, it’s nearly impossible to pick out meaningful patterns in 2020 Republican support in each category. Let’s try adding 2 different geom layers to the frame:\n\n# Side-by-side violin plots\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n# Side-by-side boxplots (defined below)\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nBox plots are constructed from five numbers - the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum value of a quantitative variable:\n\nREFLECT:\nSummarize what you’ve learned about the 2020 Republican county-level support within and between red/purple/blue states.\nExercise 8: Quantitative vs Categorical – Intuition Check\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nDon’t spend more than 3 minutes on this!\n\n\nWe can also visualize the relationship between repub_pct_20 and historical using our familiar density plots. In the plot below, notice that we simply created a separate density plot for each historical category. (The plot itself is “bad” but we’ll fix it below.) Try to adjust the code chunk below, which starts with a density plot of repub_pct_20 alone, to re-create this image.\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20,fill=historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Quantitative vs Categorical – Density Plots\nWork through the chunks below and address the comments therein.\n\n# Name two \"bad\" things about this plot\n# The color does not much and the density plot does not show each completely\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n# What does scale_fill_manual do?\n#match the color\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# What does alpha = 0.5 do?\n#It makes the plot transparent\n# Play around with different values of alpha, between 0 and 1\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# It separates each plots by color based on historical\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# Let's try a similar grouping strategy with a histogram instead of density plot.\n# Why is this terrible?\n#the meaning of the plot changes, becuase it shows a different data for historical\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\nExercise 10\nWe’ve now learned 3 (of many) ways to visualize the relationship between a quantitative and categorical variable: side-by-side violins, boxplots, and density plots.\n\nWhich do you like best? density\nWhat is one pro of density plots relative to boxplots? Density plot show the total number of data, while the box plot only shows five datas.\nWhat is one con of density plots relative to boxplots? Box plot can be more easier to read,\nExercise 11: Categorical vs Categorical – Intuition Check\nFinally, let’s simply explore who won each county in 2020 (winner_20) and how this breaks down by historical voting trends in the state. That is, let’s explore the relationship between 2 categorical variables! Following the same themes as above, we can utilize grouping features such as fill/color or facets to distinguish between different categories of winner_20 and historical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nSpend at most 5 minutes on the following intuition check. Adjust the code below to recreate the following two plots.\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 1: adjust this to recreate the top plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill=winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 2: adjust this to recreate the bottom plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()+\n  facet_wrap(~historical)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 12: Categorical vs Categorical\nConstruct the following 4 bar plot visualizations.\n\n# A stacked bar plot\n# How are the \"historical\" and \"winner_20\" variables mapped to the plot, i.e. what roles do they play?\n#historical is the x axis, and the winner fills in the plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n# A faceted bar plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# A side-by-side bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n# A proportional bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\nPart a\nName one pro and one con of using the “proportional bar plot” instead of one of the other three options. It is easier to compare the data, and it has more variables.\nPart b\nWhat’s your favorite bar plot from part and why? I prefer the third one, becuase it shows clearly the difference of number of winners historical.\nExercise 13: Practice (now or later)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecide\n\n\n\nDecide what’s best for you:\n\nTry this extra practice now.\nReflect on the above exercises and come back to this extra practice later (but before the next class).\n\n\n\nImport some daily weather data from a few locations in Australia:\n\nweather &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv\")\n\nConstruct plots that address the research questions in each chunk. You might make multiple plots–there are many ways to do things!. However, don’t just throw spaghetti at the wall.\nReflect before doing anything. What types of variables are these? How might you plot just 1 of the variables, and then tweak the plot to incorporate the other?\n\n# How do 3pm temperatures (temp3pm) differ by location?\nggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How might we predict the 3pm temperature (temp3pm) by the 9am temperature (temp9am)?\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# How do the number of rainy days (raintoday) differ by location?\nggplot(weather, aes(x = location, fill = raintoday)) + \n  geom_bar()",

There, they range from ~10 to ~45 with a typical temp around ~30 degrees.\nTemperatures tend to be lowest in Hobart. There, they range from ~5 to ~45 with a typical temp around ~15 degrees.\nWollongong temps are in between and are the least variable from day to day.\n\nSUBTLETIES: Defining fill or color by a variable\nHow we define the fill or color depends upon whether we’re defining it by a named color or by some variable in our dataset. For example:\n\ngeom___(fill = \"blue\")named colors are defined outside the aesthetics and put in quotes\ngeom___(aes(fill = variable)) or ggplot(___, aes(fill = variable))\ncolors/fills defined by a variable are defined inside the aesthetics\nExample 3\nLet’s consider Wollongong alone:\n\nCode# Don't worry about the syntax (we'll learn it soon)\nwoll &lt;- weather |&gt;\n  filter(location == \"Wollongong\") |&gt; \n  mutate(date = as.Date(date))  \n\n\n\nCode# How often does it raintoday?\n# Fill your geometric layer with the color blue.\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday))+\n  geom_bar(fill=\"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode# If it does raintoday, what does this tell us about raintomorrow?\n# Use your intuition first\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday))+\n  geom_bar(aes(fill=raintomorrow))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode# Now compare different approaches\n\n# Default: stacked bars\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode# Side-by-side bars\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode# Proportional bars\n# position = \"fill\" refers to filling the frame, nothing to do with the color-related fill\nggplot(woll, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflection\nThere’s often not one “best plot”, but a combination of plots that provide a complete picture:\n\nThe stacked and side-by-side bars reflect that on most days, it does not rain.\nThe proportional / filled bars lose that information, but make it easier to compare proportions: it’s more likely to rain tomorrow if it also rains today.\nExample 4\nConstruct a plot that illustrates how 3pm temperatures (temp3pm) vary by date in Wollongong. Represent each day on the plot and use a curve/line to help highlight the trends.\n\nCode# THINK: What variable goes on the y-axis?\n# For the curve, try adding span = 0.5 to tweak the curvature\nggplot(woll, aes(y=temp3pm,x=date))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(span = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode# Instead of a curve that captures the general TREND,\n# draw a line that illustrates the movement of RAW temperatures from day to day\n# NOTE: We haven't learned this geom yet! Guess.\nggplot(woll, aes(y = temp3pm, x = date))+\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: A line plot isn’t always appropriate! It can be useful in situations like this, when our data are chronological.\nReflection\nThere’s a seasonal / cyclic behavior in temperatures – they’re highest in January (around 23 degrees) and lowest in July (around 16 degrees). There are also some outliers – some abnormally hot and cold days.",

The addition of location adds a 3rd variable into our research questions:\n\nHow does the relationship between raintoday and raintomorrow vary by location?\nHow does the behavior of temp3pm over date vary by location?\nAnd so on.\n\nThus far, we’ve focused on the following components of a plot:\n\nsetting up a frame\n\nadding layers / geometric elements\nsplitting the plot into facets for different groups / categories\nchange the theme, e.g. axis labels, color, fill\n\nWe’ll have to think about all of this, along with scales. Scales change the color, fill, size, shape, or other properties according to the levels of a new variable. This is different than just assigning scale by, for example, color = \"blue\".\nWork on the examples below in your groups. Check in with your intuition! We’ll then discuss as a group as relevant.\nExample 5\n\nCode# Plot temp3pm vs temp9am\n# Change the code in order to indicate the location to which each data point corresponds\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am,color=location)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode# Change the code in order to indicate the location to which each data point corresponds\n# AND identify the days on which it rained / didn't raintoday\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = temp9am,color=location)) + \n  geom_point()+\n  facet_wrap(~raintoday)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode# How many ways can you think to make that plot of temp3pm vs temp9am with info about location and rain?\n# Play around!\nggplot(weather,aes(y=temp3pm,x=temp9am,color=location,shape=raintoday))+\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\nCode# Change the code in order to construct a line plot of temp3pm vs date for each separate location (no points!)\nggplot(weather, aes(y = temp3pm, x = date,color=location)) + \n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 7\n\nCode# Plot the relationship of raintomorrow & raintoday\n# Change the code in order to indicate this relationship by location\nggplot(weather, aes(x = raintoday, fill = raintomorrow,)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")+\n  facet_wrap(~location)",

    "text": "13.3 Exercises (required)\nThe story\nThough far from a perfect assessment of academic preparedness, SAT scores have historically been used as one measurement of a state’s education system. The education dataset contains various education variables for each state:\n\nCode# Import and check out data\neducation &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv\")\nhead(education)\n\n       State expend ratio salary frac verbal math  sat  fracCat\n1    Alabama  4.405  17.2 31.144    8    491  538 1029   (0,15]\n2     Alaska  8.963  17.6 47.951   47    445  489  934 (45,100]\n3    Arizona  4.778  19.3 32.175   27    448  496  944  (15,45]\n4   Arkansas  4.459  17.1 28.934    6    482  523 1005   (0,15]\n5 California  4.992  24.0 41.078   45    417  485  902  (15,45]\n6   Colorado  5.443  18.4 34.571   29    462  518  980  (15,45]\n\n\nA codebook is provided by Danny Kaplan who also made these data accessible:\n\nExercise 1: SAT scores\nPart a\nConstruct a plot of how the average sat scores vary from state to state. (Just use 1 variable – sat not State!)\n\nCodeggplot(education,aes(x=sat))+\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nSummarize your observations from the plot. Comment on the basics: range, typical outcomes, shape. (Any theories about what might explain this non-normal shape?)\nThe sat range from 800 to 1100, and most people get 900.\nExercise 2: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending & SAT Scores vs Salaries\nThe first question we’d like to answer is: Can the variability in sat scores from state to state be partially explained by how much a state spends on education, specifically its per pupil spending (expend) and typical teacher salary?\nPart a\n\nCode# Construct a plot of sat vs expend\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education,aes(y=sat,x=expend))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode# Construct a plot of sat vs salary\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\n# Construct a plot of sat vs salary\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\"\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nWhat are the relationship trends between SAT scores and spending? Is there anything that surprises you? There is a negative relationship between the expend and the score, also a negative relationship between the salary and score. It suprises me because it shows the more students spend on SAT, the lower score they will get.\nExercise 3: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending and Teacher Salaries\nConstruct one visualization of the relationship of sat with salary and expend. HINT: Start with just 2 variables and tweak that code to add the third variable. Try out a few things!\n\nCodeggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = expend)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Another way to Incorporate Scale\nIt can be tough to distinguish color scales and size scales for quantitative variables. Another option is to discretize a quantitative variable, or basically cut it up into categories.\nConstruct the plot below. Check out the code and think about what’s happening here. What happens if you change “2” to “3”?\n\nCodeggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 2))) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 3))) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"lm\")\n\n\nDescribe the trivariate relationship between sat, salary, and expend. States with lower salaries and expenditures tend to have higher SAT scores.\nExercise 5: Finally an Explanation\nIt’s strange that SAT scores seem to decrease with spending. But we’re leaving out an important variable from our analysis: the fraction of a state’s students that actually take the SAT. The fracCat variable indicates this fraction: low (under 15% take the SAT), medium (15-45% take the SAT), and high (at least 45% take the SAT).\nPart a\nBuild a univariate viz of fracCat to better understand how many states fall into each category.\n\nCodeggplot(education, aes(x = fracCat)) + \n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nBuild 2 bivariate visualizations that demonstrate the relationship between sat and fracCat. What story does your graphic tell and why does this make contextual sense?\n\nCodeggplot(education, aes(x = sat, fill = fracCat)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe more students take sat in a state, the lower the average score. #### Part c {-}\nMake a trivariate visualization that demonstrates the relationship of sat with expend AND fracCat. Highlight the differences in fracCat groups through color AND unique trend lines. What story does your graphic tell?\nDoes it still seem that SAT scores decrease as spending increases?\n\nCodeggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = expend, color = fracCat)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems when consider the fraction of students take SAT, the score increase with the expend. #### Part d {-}\nPutting all of this together, explain this example of Simpson’s Paradox. That is, why did it appear that SAT scores decrease as spending increases even though the opposite is true?\nThe states with lower expend also has a lower score, and student participation tends to be lower among states with lower expend.",

We can use it inside R through the leaflet package.\nThis uses a different plotting framework than ggplot2, but still has a tidyverse feel (which will become more clear as we learn other tidyverse tools!).\nThe general steps are as follows:\n\nCreate a map widget by calling leaflet() and telling it the data to use.\nAdd a base map using addTiles() (the default) or addProviderTiles().\nAdd layers to the map using layer functions (e.g. addMarkers(), addPolygons()).\nPrint the map widget to display it.\nExercise 1: A leaflet with markers / points\nEarlier this semester, I asked for the latitude and longitude of one of your favorite places. I rounded these to the nearest whole number, so that they’re near to but not exactly at those places. Let’s load the data and map it!\n\n\n  latitude longitude\n1       59        18\n2       45       -93\n3       33      -117\n4       40       116\n5       40       106\n6       37      -122\n\n\nPart a\nYou can use a “two-finger scroll” to zoom in and out.\n\nCode# Load the leaflet package\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\n# Just a plotting frame\nleaflet(data = fave_places)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode# Now what do we have?\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode# Now what do we have?\n# longitude and latitude refer to the variables in our data\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addMarkers(lng = ~longitude, lat = ~latitude)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode# Since we named them \"longitude\" and \"latitude\", the function\n# automatically recognizes these variables. No need to write them!\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addMarkers()\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nPLAY AROUND! This map is interactive. Zoom in on one location. Keep zooming – what level of detail can you get into? How does that detail depend upon where you try to zoom in (thus what are the limitations of this tool)?\nExercise 2: Details\nWe can change all sorts of details in leaflet maps.\n\nCode# Load package needed to change color\nlibrary(gplots)\n\n# We can add colored circles instead of markers at each location\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addCircles(color = col2hex(\"red\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode# We can change the background\n# Mark locations with yellow dots\n# And connect the dots, in their order in the dataset, with green lines\n# (These green lines don't mean anything here, but would if this were somebody's travel path!)\nleaflet(data = fave_places) |&gt;\n  addProviderTiles(\"USGS\") |&gt;\n  addCircles(weight = 10, opacity = 1, color = col2hex(\"yellow\")) |&gt;\n  addPolylines(\n    lng = ~longitude,\n    lat = ~latitude,\n    color = col2hex(\"green\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3: Your turn\nThe starbucks data, compiled by Danny Kaplan, contains information about every Starbucks in the world at the time the data were collected, including Latitude and Longitude:\n\nCode# Import starbucks location data\nstarbucks &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/starbucks.csv\")\n\n\nLet’s focus on only those in Minnesota for now:\n\nCode# Don't worry about the syntax\nstarbucks_mn &lt;- starbucks |&gt;   \n  filter(Country == \"US\", State.Province == \"MN\")\nleaflet(data = starbucks_mn) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt; \n  addMarkers()\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a leaflet map of the Starbucks locations in Minnesota. Keep it simple – go back to Exercise 1 for an example.\nPart 2: Static points on a map\nLeaflet is very powerful and fun. But:\n\nIt’s not great when we have lots of points to map – it takes lots of time.\nIt makes good interactive maps, but we often need a static map (eg: we can not print interactive maps!).\n\nLet’s explore how to make point maps with ggplot(), not leaflet().\nExercise 3: A simple scatterplot\nLet’s start with the ggplot() tools we already know. Construct a scatterplot of all starbucks locations, not just those in Minnesota, with:\n\nLatitude and Longitude coordinates (which goes on the y-axis?!)\nMake the points transparent (alpha = 0.2) and smaller (size = 0.2)\n\nIt’s pretty cool that the plots we already know can provide some spatial context. But what don’t you like about this plot?\n\nCodeggplot(starbucks, aes(y=Latitude, x=Longitude))+\n  geom_point(size=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Adding a country-level background\nLet’s add a background map of country-level boundaries.\nPart a\nFirst, we can grab country-level boundaries from the rnaturalearth package.\n\nCode# Load the package\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\n\n# Get info about country boundaries across the world\n# in a \"sf\" or simple feature format\nworld_boundaries &lt;- ne_countries(returnclass = \"sf\")\n\n\nIn your console, type world_boundaries to check out what’s stored there. Don’t print it our in your Rmd – printing it would be really messy there (even just the head()).\nPart b\nRun the chunks below to build up a new map.\n\nCodelibrary(ggplot2)\n# What does this code produce?\n# What geom are we using for the point map?\nggplot(world_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode# Load package needed to change map theme\nlibrary(mosaic)\n\n# Add a point for each Starbucks\n# NOTE: The Starbucks info is in our starbucks data, not world_boundaries\n# How does this change how we use geom_point?!\nggplot(world_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf() + \n  geom_point(\n    data = starbucks,\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    alpha = 0.3, size = 0.2, color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n  theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nSummarize what you learned about Starbucks from this map. Starbucks is mainly concentrated in the United States, Europe and East Asia.\nExercise 5: Zooming in on some countries\nInstead of world_boundaries &lt;- ne_countries(returnclass = 'sf') we could zoom in on…\n\nthe continent of Africa: ne_countries(continent = 'Africa', returnclass = 'sf')\n\na set of countries: ne_countries(country = c('france', 'united kingdom', 'germany'), returnclass = 'sf')\n\nboundaries within a country: ne_states(country = 'united states of america', returnclass = 'sf')\n\n\nOur goal here will be to map the Starbucks locations in Canada, Mexico, and the US.\nPart a\nTo make this map, we again need two pieces of information.\n\nData on Starbucks for only Canada, Mexico, and the US, labeled as “CA”, “MX”, “US” in the starbucks data.\n\n\nCode# We'll learn this syntax soon! Don't worry about it now.\nstarbucks_cma &lt;- starbucks |&gt; \n  filter(Country %in% c('CA', 'MX', 'US'))\n\n\n\nA background map of state- and national-level boundaries in Canada, Mexico, and the US. This requires ne_states() in the rnaturalearth package where the countries are labeled ‘canada’, ‘mexico’, ‘united states of america’.\n\n\nCodecma_boundaries &lt;- ne_states(\n  country = c(\"canada\", \"mexico\", \"united states of america\"),\n  returnclass = \"sf\")\n\n\nPart b\nMake the map!\n\nCode# Just the boundaries\nggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode# Add the points\n# And zoom in\nggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf() + \n  geom_point(\n    data = starbucks_cma,\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    alpha = 0.3,\n    size = 0.2,\n    color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-179.14, -50)) +\n  theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6: A state and county-level map\nLet’s get an even higher resolution map of Starbucks locations within the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota, with a background map at the county-level.\nPart a\nTo make this map, we again need two pieces of information.\n\nData on Starbucks for only the states of interest.\n\n\nCodestarbucks_midwest &lt;- starbucks |&gt; \n  filter(State.Province %in% c(\"MN\", \"ND\", \"SD\", \"WI\"))\n\n\n\nA background map of state- and county-level boundaries in these states. This requires st_as_sf() in the sf package, and map() in the maps package, where the countries are labeled ‘minnesota’, ‘north dakota’, etc.\n\n\nCode# Load packages\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(maps)\n\n# Get the boundaries\nmidwest_boundaries &lt;- st_as_sf(\n  maps::map(\"county\",\n            region = c(\"minnesota\", \"wisconsin\", \"north dakota\", \"south dakota\"), \n            fill = TRUE, plot = FALSE))\n\n# Check it out\nhead(midwest_boundaries)\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 1 field\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -96.81268 ymin: 45.05167 xmax: -93.01397 ymax: 48.53526\nGeodetic CRS:  +proj=longlat +ellps=clrk66 +no_defs +type=crs\n                                     ID                           geom\nminnesota,aitkin       minnesota,aitkin MULTIPOLYGON (((-93.03689 4...\nminnesota,anoka         minnesota,anoka MULTIPOLYGON (((-93.51817 4...\nminnesota,becker       minnesota,becker MULTIPOLYGON (((-95.14537 4...\nminnesota,beltrami   minnesota,beltrami MULTIPOLYGON (((-95.58655 4...\nminnesota,benton       minnesota,benton MULTIPOLYGON (((-93.77027 4...\nminnesota,big stone minnesota,big stone MULTIPOLYGON (((-96.10794 4...\n\n\nPart b\nAdjust the code below to make the plot!

Consider the Starbucks locations in Canada, Mexico, and the US that we mapped earlier:\n\nCode# Point map (we made this earlier)\nggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf() + \n  geom_point(\n    data = starbucks_cma,\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    alpha = 0.3,\n    size = 0.2,\n    color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-179.14, -50), ylim = c(14.54, 83.11)) +\n  theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow check out the contour map.\n\nCode# What changed in the plot?\n# What changed in our code?!\nggplot(cma_boundaries) + \n  geom_sf() + \n  geom_density_2d(\n    data = starbucks_cma,\n    aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude),\n    size = 0.2,\n    color = \"darkgreen\"\n  ) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-179.14, -50), ylim = c(14.54, 83.11)) +\n  theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 3: Choropleth maps\nSpatial data isn’t always in the form of point locations! For example, recall the state and county-level data on presidential elections.\n\nCodeelections_by_state &lt;-  read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_by_state.csv\")\nelections_by_counties &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_county.csv\")\n\n\nIn these datasets, we’re interested in the overall election outcome by region (state or county), not the specific geographic location of some observation. Let’s wrangle our data first. We’ll focus on just a few variables of interest, and create a new variable (repub_20_categories) that discretizes the repub_pct_20 variable into increments of 5 percentage points (for states) or 10 percentage points (for counties):\n\nCode# Don't worry about the code!\n\nelections_by_state &lt;- elections_by_state |&gt; \n  filter(state_abbr != \"DC\") |&gt; \n  select(state_name, state_abbr, repub_pct_20) |&gt; \n  mutate(repub_20_categories = \n           cut(repub_pct_20, \n               breaks = seq(30, 70, by = 5), \n               labels = c(\"30-34\", \"35-39\", \"40-44\", \"45-49\",\n                          \"50-54\", \"55-59\", \"60-64\", \"65-70\"), \n               include.lowest = TRUE))\n\nelections_by_counties &lt;- elections_by_counties |&gt; \n  select(state_name, state_abbr, county_name, county_fips,\n          repub_pct_20, median_age, median_rent) |&gt; \n  mutate(repub_20_categories = \n           cut(repub_pct_20, \n               breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 10),\n               labels = c(\"0-9\", \"10-19\", \"20-29\", \"30-39\", \"40-49\",\n                          \"50-59\", \"60-69\", \"70-79\", \"80-89\", \"90-100\"),\n               include.lowest = TRUE))\n\n\nExercise 8: State-level choropleth maps\nLet’s map the 2020 Republican support in each state, repub_pct_20.\nPart a\nWe again need two pieces of information.\n\nData on elections in each state, which we already have: elections_by_state.\nA background map of state boundaries in the US. The boundaries we used for point maps don’t work here. (Optional detail: they’re sf objects and we now need a data.frame object.) Instead, we can use the map_data() function from the ggplot2 package:\n\n\nCode# Get the latitude and longitude coordinates of state boundaries\nstates_map &lt;- map_data(\"state\")\n\n# Check it out\nhead(states_map)\n\n       long      lat group order  region subregion\n1 -87.46201 30.38968     1     1 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n2 -87.48493 30.37249     1     2 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n3 -87.52503 30.37249     1     3 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n4 -87.53076 30.33239     1     4 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n5 -87.57087 30.32665     1     5 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n6 -87.58806 30.32665     1     6 alabama      &lt;NA&gt;\n\n\nPause\nImportant detail: Note that the region variable in states_map, and the state_name variable in elections_by_state both label states by the full name in lower case letters.

Our elections_by_counties data refers to each county by a county_fips code, which is mostly the same as id, BUT drops any 0’s at the beginning of the code.\n\nCodehead(county_map)\n\n     long      lat order  hole piece            group    id\n1 1225889 -1275020     1 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n2 1235324 -1274008     2 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n3 1244873 -1272331     3 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n4 1244129 -1267515     4 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n5 1272010 -1262889     5 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n6 1276797 -1295514     6 FALSE     1 0500000US01001.1 01001\n\nCodehead(elections_by_counties)\n\n  state_name state_abbr    county_name county_fips repub_pct_20 median_age\n1    Alabama         AL Autauga County        1001        71.44       37.5\n2    Alabama         AL Baldwin County        1003        76.17       41.5\n3    Alabama         AL Barbour County        1005        53.45       38.3\n4    Alabama         AL    Bibb County        1007        78.43       39.4\n5    Alabama         AL  Blount County        1009        89.57       39.6\n6    Alabama         AL Bullock County        1011        24.84       39.6\n  median_rent repub_20_categories\n1         668               70-79\n2         693               70-79\n3         382               50-59\n4         351               70-79\n5         403               80-89\n6         276               20-29\n\n\nThis just means that we have to wrangle the data so that it can communicate with the background map.\n\nCode# Add 0's at the beginning of any fips_code that's fewer than 5 numbers long\n# Don't worry about the syntax\nelections_by_counties &lt;- elections_by_counties |&gt; \n  mutate(county_fips = as.character(county_fips)) |&gt; \n  mutate(county_fips = \n           ifelse(nchar(county_fips) == 4, paste0(\"0\", county_fips), county_fips))\n\n\nPart b\nNow map Republican support by county. Let’s go straight to the discretized repub_20_categories variable, and a good color scale.\n\nCodeggplot(elections_by_counties, aes(map_id = county_fips, fill = repub_20_categories)) +\n  geom_map(map = county_map) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = rev(brewer.pal(10, \"RdBu\")), name = \"% Republican\") +\n  expand_limits(x = county_map$long, y = county_map$lat) +\n  theme_map() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\") + \n  coord_equal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10: Play around!\nConstruct county-level maps of median_rent and median_age.\nExercise 11: Choropleth maps with leaflet\nThough ggplot() is often better for this purpose, we can also make choropleth maps with leaflet().

For each chunk below, indicate what the code does.\n\n#  Calculate the median Repub vote percentage in 2020 across all counties\n elections_small |&gt; \n   summarize(median(repub_pct_20))\n\n  median(repub_pct_20)\n1                68.29\n\n\n\n# Calculate the median Repub vote percentage in 2020 across all counties AND name it \"median_repub\"\n elections_small |&gt; \n   summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20))\n\n  median_repub\n1        68.29\n\n\n\n#  Calculate the median Repub vote percentage in 2020 across all counties AND the total number of votes across all counties AND name the results\n elections_small |&gt; \n   summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20), total_votes = sum(total_votes_20))\n\n  median_repub total_votes\n1        68.29   157949293\n\n\nExercise 8: summarize + group_by demo\nFinally, group_by() groups the units of observation or rows of a data frame by a specified set of variables. Alone, this function doesn’t change the appearance of our dataset or seem to do anything at all:\n\n# Calculate the median 2020 Repub percent and total votes BY STATE\nelections_small |&gt; \n  group_by(state_name) |&gt; \n  summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20), total_votes = sum(total_votes_20)) \n\n# A tibble: 50 × 3\n   state_name           median_repub total_votes\n   &lt;chr&gt;                       &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Alabama                      70.6     2323304\n 2 Arizona                      57.9     3387326\n 3 Arkansas                     72.1     1219069\n 4 California                   44.8    17495906\n 5 Colorado                     56.2     3256953\n 6 Connecticut                  41.0     1824280\n 7 Delaware                     47.1      504010\n 8 District of Columbia          5.4      344356\n 9 Florida                      64.6    11067456\n10 Georgia                      68       4997716\n# ℹ 40 more rows\n\n\nThough it does change the underlying structure of the dataset:\n\n# Check out the structure before and after group_by\n elections_small |&gt; \n   class()\n\n[1] \"data.frame\"\n\n elections_small |&gt; \n   group_by(state_name) |&gt; \n   class()\n\n[1] \"grouped_df\" \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\n\nWhere it really shines is in partnership with summarize().\n\n# What does this do?\n# (What if we didn't use group_by?)\n elections_small |&gt; \n   group_by(state_name) |&gt; \n   summarize(median_repub = median(repub_pct_20), total_votes = sum(total_votes_20)) \n\n# A tibble: 50 × 3\n   state_name           median_repub total_votes\n   &lt;chr&gt;                       &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Alabama                      70.6     2323304\n 2 Arizona                      57.9     3387326\n 3 Arkansas                     72.1     1219069\n 4 California                   44.8    17495906\n 5 Colorado                     56.2     3256953\n 6 Connecticut                  41.0     1824280\n 7 Delaware                     47.1      504010\n 8 District of Columbia          5.4      344356\n 9 Florida                      64.6    11067456\n10 Georgia                      68       4997716\n# ℹ 40 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflect\n\n\n\nNotice that group_by() with summarize() produces new data frame or tibble!

    "text": "17.1 Exercises\nExercise 1: Where are my keys?\nPart a\nDefine two new datasets, with different students and courses:\n\nstudents_2 &lt;- data.frame(\n  student = c(\"D\", \"E\", \"F\"),\n  class = c(\"COMP 101\", \"BIOL 101\", \"POLI 101\")\n)\n\n# Check it out\nstudents_2\n\n  student    class\n1       D COMP 101\n2       E BIOL 101\n3       F POLI 101\n\nenrollments_2 &lt;- data.frame(\n  course = c(\"ART 101\", \"BIOL 101\", \"COMP 101\"),\n  enrollment = c(18, 20, 19)\n)\n\n# Check it out\nenrollments_2\n\n    course enrollment\n1  ART 101         18\n2 BIOL 101         20\n3 COMP 101         19\n\n\nTo connect the course enrollments to the students’ courses, try do a left_join(). You get an error! Identify the problem by reviewing the error message and the datasets we’re trying to join.\n\n# eval = FALSE: don't evaluate this chunk when knitting. it produces an error.\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2)\n\nPart b\nThe problem is that course name, the key or variable that links these two datasets, is labeled differently: class in the students_2 data and course in the enrollments_2 data. Thus we have to specify these keys in our code:\n\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2, join_by(class == course))\n\n  student    class enrollment\n1       D COMP 101         19\n2       E BIOL 101         20\n3       F POLI 101         NA\n\n\n\n# The order of the keys is important:\n# join_by(\"left data key\" == \"right data key\")\n# The order is mixed up here, thus we get an error:\nstudents_2 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_2, join_by(course == class))\n\nPart c\nDefine another set of fake data which adds grade information:\n\n# Add student grades in each course\nstudents_3 &lt;- data.frame(\n  student = c(\"Y\", \"Y\", \"Z\", \"Z\"),\n  class = c(\"COMP 101\", \"BIOL 101\", \"POLI 101\", \"COMP 101\"),\n  grade = c(\"B\", \"S\", \"C\", \"A\")\n)\n\n# Check it out\nstudents_3\n\n  student    class grade\n1       Y COMP 101     B\n2       Y BIOL 101     S\n3       Z POLI 101     C\n4       Z COMP 101     A\n\n# Add average grades in each course\nenrollments_3 &lt;- data.frame(\n  class = c(\"ART 101\", \"BIOL 101\",\"COMP 101\"),\n  grade = c(\"B\", \"A\", \"A-\"),\n  enrollment = c(20, 18, 19)\n)\n\n# Check it out\nenrollments_3\n\n     class grade enrollment\n1  ART 101     B         20\n2 BIOL 101     A         18\n3 COMP 101    A-         19\n\n\nTry doing a left_join() to link the students’ classes to their enrollment info.

Try and figure out the culprit by examining the output.\n\nstudents_3 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_3)\n\n  student    class grade enrollment\n1       Y COMP 101     B         NA\n2       Y BIOL 101     S         NA\n3       Z POLI 101     C         NA\n4       Z COMP 101     A         NA\n\n\nPart d\nThe issue here is that our datasets have 2 column names in common: class and grade. BUT grade is measuring 2 different things here: individual student grades in students_3 and average student grades in enrollments_3. Thus it doesn’t make sense to try to join the datasets with respect to this variable. We can again solve this by specifying that we want to join the datasets using the class variable as a key. What are grade.x and grade.y?\n\nstudents_3 |&gt; \n  left_join(enrollments_3, join_by(class == class))\n\n  student    class grade.x grade.y enrollment\n1       Y COMP 101       B      A-         19\n2       Y BIOL 101       S       A         18\n3       Z POLI 101       C    &lt;NA&gt;         NA\n4       Z COMP 101       A      A-         19\n\n\nExercise 2: More small practice\nBefore applying these ideas to bigger datasets, let’s practice identifying which join is appropriate in different scenarios. Define the following fake data on voters (people who have voted) and contact info for voting age adults (people who could vote):\n\n# People who have voted\nvoters &lt;- data.frame(\n  id = c(\"A\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\"),\n  times_voted = c(2, 4, 17, 6, 20)\n)\n\nvoters\n\n  id times_voted\n1  A           2\n2  D           4\n3  E          17\n4  F           6\n5  G          20\n\n# Contact info for voting age adults\ncontact &lt;- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\"),\n  address = c(\"summit\", \"grand\", \"snelling\", \"fairview\"),\n  age = c(24, 89, 43, 38)\n)\n\ncontact\n\n  name  address age\n1    A   summit  24\n2    B    grand  89\n3    C snelling  43\n4    D fairview  38\n\n\nUse the appropriate join for each prompt below. In each case, think before you type:\n\nWhat dataset goes on the left?\nWhat do you want the resulting dataset to look like? How many rows and columns will it have?\n\n\n# 1. We want contact info for people who HAVEN'T voted\ncontact |&gt; \n  anti_join(voters, join_by(name == id))\n\n  name  address age\n1    B    grand  89\n2    C snelling  43\n\n# 2.

In grades, each row is a student-class pair with information on:\n\n\nsid = student ID\n\ngrade = student’s grade\n\nsessionID = an identifier of the class section\n\n\n# Get rid of some duplicate rows!\ngrades &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/grades.csv\") |&gt; \n  distinct(sid, sessionID, .keep_all = TRUE)\nhead(grades)\n\n     sid grade   sessionID\n1 S31185    D+ session1784\n2 S31185    B+ session1785\n3 S31185    A- session1791\n4 S31185    B+ session1792\n5 S31185    B- session1794\n6 S31185    C+ session1795\n\n\nIn courses, each row corresponds to a class section with information on:\n\n\nsessionID = an identifier of the class section\n\ndept = department\n\nlevel = course level (eg: 100)\n\nsem = semester\n\nenroll = enrollment (number of students)\n\niid = instructor ID\n\n\n\n    sessionID dept level    sem enroll     iid\n1 session1784    M   100 FA1991     22 inst265\n2 session1785    k   100 FA1991     52 inst458\n3 session1791    J   100 FA1993     22 inst223\n4 session1792    J   300 FA1993     20 inst235\n5 session1794    J   200 FA1993     22 inst234\n6 session1795    J   200 SP1994     26 inst230\n\n\nUse R code to take a quick glance at the data.\n\n# How many observations (rows) and variables (columns) are there in the grades data?\ndim(grades)\n\n[1] 5844    3\n\n# How many observations (rows) and variables (columns) are there in the courses data?\ndim(courses)\n\n[1] 1718    6\n\n\nExercise 4: Class size\nHow big are the classes?\nPart a\nBefore digging in, note that some courses are listed twice in the courses data:\n\ncourses |&gt; \n  count(sessionID) |&gt; \n  filter(n &gt; 1)\n\n     sessionID n\n1  session2047 2\n2  session2067 2\n3  session2448 2\n4  session2509 2\n5  session2541 2\n6  session2824 2\n7  session2826 2\n8  session2862 2\n9  session2897 2\n10 session3046 2\n11 session3057 2\n12 session3123 2\n13 session3243 2\n14 session3257 2\n15 session3387 2\n16 session3400 2\n17 session3414 2\n18 session3430 2\n19 session3489 2\n20 session3524 2\n21 session3629 2\n22 session3643 2\n23 session3821 2\n\n\nIf we pick out just 1 of these, we learn that some courses are cross-listed in multiple departments:\n\ncourses |&gt; \n  filter(sessionID == \"session2047\")\n\n    sessionID dept level    sem enroll     iid\n1 session2047    g   100 FA2001     12 inst436\n2 session2047    m   100 FA2001     28 inst436\n\n\nFor our class size exploration, obtain the total enrollments in each sessionID, combining any cross-listed sections. Save this as courses_combined.

To this end, calculate the median class size across all class sections. (The median is the middle or 50th percentile. Unlike the mean, it’s not skewed by outliers.) THINK FIRST:\n\nWhich of the 2 datasets do you need to answer this question? One? Both?\nIf you need course information, use courses_combined not courses.\nDo you have to do any joining? If so, which dataset will go on the left, i.e. which dataset includes your primary observations of interest?

To this end, calculate the median class size for each individual student. Once you have the correct output, store it as student_class_size. THINK FIRST:\n\nWhich of the 2 datasets do you need to answer this question? One? Both?\nIf you need course information, use courses_combined not courses.\nDo you have to do any joining?

Let’s get the data ready for that analysis here. Make the following changes to the courses_clean data. Because they have different enrollment structures, and we don’t want to compare apples and oranges, remove the following:\n\nall sections in PE and INTD (interdisciplinary studies courses)\nall music ensembles and dance practicums, i.e. all MUSI and THDA classes with numbers less than 100. HINT: !(dept == \"MUSI\" & as.numeric(number) &lt; 100)\nall lab sections. Be careful which variable you use here. For example, you don’t want to search by “Lab” and accidentally eliminate courses with words such as “Labor”.\n\nSave the results as enrollments (don’t overwrite courses_clean).\n\nenrollments &lt;- courses_clean |&gt; \n  filter(dept != \"PE\", dept != \"INTD\") |&gt; \n  filter(!(dept == \"MUSI\" & as.numeric(number) &lt; 100)) |&gt; \n  filter(!(dept == \"THDA\" & as.numeric(number) &lt; 100)) |&gt; \n  filter(!str_detect(section, \"L\"))\n  \nhead(enrollments)\n\n  dept number section   crn                                                name\n1 AMST    112      01 10318         Introduction to African American Literature\n2 AMST    194      01 10073              Introduction to Asian American Studies\n3 AMST    194      F1 10072 What’s After White Empire - And Is It Already Here?\n4 AMST    203      01 10646 Politics and Inequality: The American Welfare State\n5 AMST    205      01 10842                         Trans Theories and Politics\n6 AMST    209      01 10474                   Civil Rights in the United States\n   days            time      room             instructor avail max enroll\n1 M W F 9:40 - 10:40 am  MAIN 009       Daylanne English     3  20     17\n2 M W F  1:10 - 2:10 pm MUSIC 219          Jake Nagasawa    -4  16     20\n3  T R   3:00 - 4:30 pm   HUM 214 Karin Aguilar-San Juan     0  14     14\n4 M W F 9:40 - 10:40 am  CARN 305          Lesley Lavery     3  25     22\n5  T R   3:00 - 4:30 pm  MAIN 009              Myrl Beam    -2  20     22\n6   W   7:00 - 10:00 pm  MAIN 010         Walter Greason    -1  15     16",

    "text": "Exercise 1: Save Data Locally\nPart a\nOn your laptop:\n\nDownload the “imdb_5000_messy.csv” file from Moodle\nMove it to the data folder in your portfolio repository\nPart b\nHot tip: After saving your data file, it’s important to record appropriate citations and info in either a new qmd (eg: “imdb_5000_messy_README.qmd”) or in the qmd where you’ll analyze the data. These citations should include:\n\nthe data source, i.e. where you found the data\nthe data creator, i.e. who / what group collected the original data\npossibly a data codebook, i.e. descriptions of the data variables\n\nTo this end, check out where we originally got our IMDB data:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata\nAfter visiting that website, take some quick notes here on the data source and creator.\nExercise 2: Import Data to RStudio\nNow that we have a local copy of our data file, let’s get it into RStudio! Remember that this process depends on 2 things: the file type and location. Since our file type is a csv, we can import it using read_csv(). But we have to supply the file location through a file path. To this end, we can either use an absolute file path or a relative file path.\nPart a\nAn absolute file path describes the location of a file starting from the root or home directory. How we refer to the user root directory depends upon your machine:\n\nOn a Mac: ~\n\nOn Windows: typically C:\\\n\n\nThen the complete file path to the IMDB data file in the data folder, depending on your machine an where you created your portfolio project, can be:\n\nOn a Mac: ~/Desktop/portfolio/data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\nOn Windows: C:\\Desktop\\portfolio\\data\\imdb_5000_messy.csv or C:\\\\Desktop\\\\portfolio\\\\data\\\\imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\n\nPutting this together, use read_csv() with the appropriate absolute file path to import your data into RStudio. Save this as imdb_messy.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n imdb_messy &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Documents/GitHub/portfolio-Xfang117/data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\")\n\nPart b\nAbsolute file paths can get really long, depending upon our number of sub-folders, and they should not be used when sharing code with other and instead relative file paths should be used. A relative file path describes the location of a file from the current “working directory”, i.e. where RStudio would currently look for on your computer. Check what your working directory is inside this qmd:\n\n# This should be the folder where you stored this qmd!\ngetwd()\n\n[1] \"/Users/xifangyd/Documents/GitHub/portfolio-Xfang117/ica\"\n\n\nNext, check what the working directory is for the console by typing getwd() in the console. This is probably different, meaning that the relative file paths that will work in your qmd won’t work in the console! You can either exclusively work inside your qmd, or change the working directory in your console, by navigating to the following in the upper toolbar: Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; To Source File location.\nPart c\nAs a good practice, we created a data folder and saved our data file (imdb_5000_messy.csv) into.\nSince our .qmd analysis and .csv data live in the same project, we don’t have to write out absolute file paths that go all the way to the root directory. We can use relative file paths that start from where our code file exists to where the data file exist:\n\nOn a Mac: ../data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\nOn Windows: ..\\data\\imdb_5000_messy.csv or ..\\\\data\\\\imdb_5000_messy.csv\n\n\nNOTE: .. means go up one level in the file hierarchy, ie, go to the parent folder/directory.\nPutting this together, use read_csv() with the appropriate relative file path to import your data into RStudio. Save this as imdb_temp (temp for “temporary”). Convince yourself that this worked, i.e. you get the same dataset as imdb_messy.\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- read_csv(\"../data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\")\n\nPart d: OPTIONAL\nSometimes, we don’t want to import the entire dataset. For example, we might want to…\n\nskips some rows, eg, if they’re just “filler”\nonly import the first “n” rows, eg, if the dataset is really large\nonly import a random subset of “n” rows, eg, if the dataset is really large\n\nThe “data import cheat sheet” at the top of this qmd, or Google, are handy resources here. As one example…\n\n# Try importing only the first 5 rows\nread_csv(\"../data/imdb_5000_messy.csv\", n_max = 5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 29\n   ...1 color director_name     num_critic_for_reviews duration\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                              &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1 Color James Cameron                        723      178\n2     2 Color Gore Verbinski                       302      169\n3     3 Color Sam Mendes                           602      148\n4     4 Color Christopher Nolan                    813      164\n5     5 &lt;NA&gt;  Doug Walker                           NA       NA\n# ℹ 24 more variables: director_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   actor_3_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;, actor_2_name &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   actor_1_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;, gross &lt;dbl&gt;, genres &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   actor_1_name &lt;chr&gt;, movie_title &lt;chr&gt;, num_voted_users &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   cast_total_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;, actor_3_name &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   facenumber_in_poster &lt;dbl&gt;, plot_keywords &lt;chr&gt;, movie_imdb_link &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   num_user_for_reviews &lt;dbl&gt;, language &lt;chr&gt;, country &lt;chr&gt;, …\n\n\nExercise 3: Check Data\nAfter importing new data into RStudio, you MUST do some quick checks of the data. Here are two first steps that are especially useful.\nPart a\nOpen imdb_messy in the spreadsheet-like viewer by typing View(imdb_messy) in the console.

Is there anything you’d need to clean before using this data?\nExercise 4: Clean Data: Factor Variables 1\nIf you didn’t already in Exercise 3, check out the color variable in the imdb_messy dataset.\n\nWhat’s goofy about this / what do we need to fix?\nMore specifically, what different categories does the color variable take, and how many movies fall into each of these categories?\n\n\nimdb_messy |&gt; \n  count(color)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  color               n\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt;\n1 B&W                10\n2 Black and White   199\n3 COLOR              30\n4 Color            4755\n5 color              30\n6 &lt;NA&gt;               19\n\n\nExercise 5: Clean Data: Factor Variables 2\nWhen working with categorical variables like color, the categories must be “clean”, i.e. consistent and in the correct format. Let’s make that happen.\nPart a\nWe could open the .csv file in, say, Excel or Google sheets, clean up the color variable, save a clean copy, and then reimport that into RStudio. BUT that would be the wrong thing to do. Why is it important to use R code, which we then save inside this qmd, to clean our data?\nIt is not reproducible. By using R code, it is helpful to repoduce those steps. #### Part b {.unnumbered}\nLet’s use R code to change the color variable so that it appropriately combines the various categories into only 2: Color and Black_White. We’ve learned a couple sets of string-related tools that could be handy here. First, starting with the imdb_messy data, change the color variable using one of the functions we learned in the Factors lesson.\nfct_relevel(), fct_recode(), fct_reorder()\nStore your results in imdb_temp (don’t overwrite imdb_messy). To check your work, print out a count() table of the color variable in imdb_temp.\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- imdb_messy |&gt; \n  mutate(color = fct_recode(color,\n                            \"Color\" = \"COLOR\",\n                            \"Color\" = \"color\",\n                            \"Black_White\" = \"B&W\",\n                            \"Black_White\" = \"Black and White\"))\n\nimdb_temp |&gt; \n  count(color)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  color           n\n  &lt;fct&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 Black_White   209\n2 Color        4815\n3 &lt;NA&gt;           19\n\n\nPart c\nRepeat Part b using one of our string functions from the String lesson:\nstr_replace(), str_replace_all(), str_to_lower(), str_sub(), str_length(), str_detect()\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- imdb_messy |&gt; \n  mutate(color = str_replace(color, \"COLOR\", \"Color\"),\n         color = str_replace(color, \"color\", \"Color\"),\n         color = str_replace(color, \"B&W\", \"Black_White\"),\n         color = str_replace(color, \"Black and White\", \"Black_White\"))\n\nimdb_temp |&gt; \n  count(color)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  color           n\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 Black_White   209\n2 Color        4815\n3 &lt;NA&gt;           19\n\n\nExercise 6: Clean Data: Missing Data 1\nThroughout these exercises, you’ve probably noticed that there’s a bunch of missing data. This is encoded as NA (not available) in R. There are a few questions to address about missing data:\n\n\nHow many values are missing data? What’s the volume of the missingness?\n\nWhy are some values missing?\n\nWhat should we do about the missing values?\n\nLet’s consider the first 2 questions in this exercise.\nPart a\nAs a first step, let’s simply understand the volume of NAs. Specifically:\n\n# Count the total number of rows in imdb_messy\nnrow(imdb_messy)\n\n[1] 5043\n\n# Then count the number of NAs in each column\ncolSums(is.na(imdb_messy))\n\n                     ...1                     color             director_name \n                        0                        19                       104 \n   num_critic_for_reviews                  duration   director_facebook_likes \n                       50                        15                       104 \n   actor_3_facebook_likes              actor_2_name    actor_1_facebook_likes \n                       23                        13                         7 \n                    gross                    genres              actor_1_name \n                      884                         0                         7 \n              movie_title           num_voted_users cast_total_facebook_likes \n                        0                         0                         0 \n             actor_3_name      facenumber_in_poster             plot_keywords \n                       23                        13                       153 \n          movie_imdb_link      num_user_for_reviews                  language \n                        0                        21                        12 \n                  country            content_rating                    budget \n                        5                       303                       492 \n               title_year    actor_2_facebook_likes                imdb_score \n                      108                        13                         0 \n             aspect_ratio      movie_facebook_likes \n                      329                         0 \n\n# Then count the number of NAs in a specific column\nimdb_messy |&gt; \n  filter(is.na(is.na(actor_1_facebook_likes)))\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 29\n# ℹ 29 variables: ...1 &lt;dbl&gt;, color &lt;chr&gt;, director_name &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   num_critic_for_reviews &lt;dbl&gt;, duration &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   director_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;, actor_3_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   actor_2_name &lt;chr&gt;, actor_1_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;, gross &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   genres &lt;chr&gt;, actor_1_name &lt;chr&gt;, movie_title &lt;chr&gt;, num_voted_users &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   cast_total_facebook_likes &lt;dbl&gt;, actor_3_name &lt;chr&gt;,\n#   facenumber_in_poster &lt;dbl&gt;, plot_keywords &lt;chr&gt;, movie_imdb_link &lt;chr&gt;, …\n\n\nPart b\nAs a second step, let’s think about why some values are missing. Study the individual observations with NAs carefully. Why do you think they are missing? Are certain films more likely to have more NAs than others?\nPart c\nConsider a more specific example. Obtain a dataset of movies that are missing data on actor_1_facebook_likes. Then explain why you think there are NAs.

There is no perfect or universal approach here. Rather, we must think carefully about…\n\nWhy the values are missing?\nWhat we want to do with our data?\nWhat is the impact of removing or replacing missing data on our work / conclusions?\n\nPart a\nCalculate the average duration of a film. THINK: How can we deal with the NA’s?\n\nimdb_messy |&gt; \n  summarize(mean(duration, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `mean(duration, na.rm = TRUE)`\n                           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1                           107.\n\n\nFollow-up:\nHow are the NAs dealt with here? Did we have to create and save a new dataset in order to do this analysis? We just remove the NAs from the calculation. No need to entirely remove the related movies from the dataset. #### Part b {.unnumbered}\nTry out the drop_na() function:\n\n# imdb_temp &lt;- drop_na(imdb_messy)\nimdb_temp &lt;- drop_na(imdb_messy)\nnrow(imdb_temp)\n\n[1] 3756\n\ncolSums(is.na(imdb_temp))\n\n                     ...1                     color             director_name \n                        0                         0                         0 \n   num_critic_for_reviews                  duration   director_facebook_likes \n                        0                         0                         0 \n   actor_3_facebook_likes              actor_2_name    actor_1_facebook_likes \n                        0                         0                         0 \n                    gross                    genres              actor_1_name \n                        0                         0                         0 \n              movie_title           num_voted_users cast_total_facebook_likes \n                        0                         0                         0 \n             actor_3_name      facenumber_in_poster             plot_keywords \n                        0                         0                         0 \n          movie_imdb_link      num_user_for_reviews                  language \n                        0                         0                         0 \n                  country            content_rating                    budget \n                        0                         0                         0 \n               title_year    actor_2_facebook_likes                imdb_score \n                        0                         0                         0 \n             aspect_ratio      movie_facebook_likes \n                        0                         0 \n\n\nFollow-up questions:\n\nWhat did drop_na() do? How many data points are left?\nIn what situations might this function be a good idea?\nIn what situations might this function be a bad idea?\nPart c\ndrop_na() removes data points that have any NA values, even if we don’t care about the variable(s) for which data is missing. This can result in losing a lot of data points that do have data on the variables we actually care about! For example, suppose we only want to explore the relationship between film duration and whether it’s in color. Check out a plot:\n\n ggplot(imdb_messy, aes(x = duration, fill = color)) + \n   geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow-up:\n\nCreate a new dataset with only and all movies that have complete info on duration and color. HINT: You could use !is.na(___) or drop_na() (differently than above)\nUse this new dataset to create a new and improved plot.\nHow many movies remain in your new dataset? Hence why this is better than using the dataset from part b?\n\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- imdb_messy |&gt; \n  select(duration, color) |&gt; \n  drop_na()\ndim(imdb_temp)\n\n[1] 5010    2\n\n\nPart d\nIn some cases, missing data is more non-data than unknown data. For example, the films with NAs for actor_1_facebook_likes actually have 0 Facebook likes–they don’t even have actors! In these cases, we can replace the NAs with a 0. Use the replace_na() function to create a new dataset (imdb_temp) that replaces the NAs in actor_1_facebook_likes with 0. You’ll have to check out the help file for this function.\n\nimdb_temp &lt;- imdb_messy |&gt; \n  mutate(actor_1_facebook_likes =\n         replace_na(actor_1_facebook_likes, 0))\n\nimdb_temp |&gt; \n  summarize(sum(is.na(actor_1_facebook_likes)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  `sum(is.na(actor_1_facebook_likes))`\n                                 &lt;int&gt;\n1                                    0\n\n\nExercise 8: New Data + Projects\nLet’s practice the above ideas while also planting some seeds for the course project. Each group will pick and analyze their own dataset. The people you’re sitting with today aren’t necessarily your project groups! BUT do some brainstorming together:\n\nShare with each other: What are some personal hobbies or passions or things you’ve been thinking about or things you’d like to learn more about? Don’t think too hard about this! Just share what’s at the top of mind today.\nEach individual: Find a dataset online that’s related to one of the topics you shared in the above prompt.\nDiscuss what data you found with your group!\nLoad the data into RStudio, perform some basic checks, and perform some preliminary cleaning, as necessary.",
